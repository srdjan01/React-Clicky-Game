## Instructions
Click on character/card and progress bar will move. If same character is clicked progress bar will roll back to 0.



## Requirements
For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Code Higlights

### Using a function to render html with React
The beauty of React lies in how fast it renders to the DOM and using state to handle client side functionality without the use of jQuery. Here my heart containers are rendered as div's with their styling applied via CSS. They are looped for and added to the DOM everytime the user gains a heart.
